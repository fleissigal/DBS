Explanation


The 'Profile' model:

Each profile is linked to a user model, which has the username, password, email etc.
We can add fields to that later, such as address or phone number.
In addition a field "houses" which links to all the houses a user has (up to 10 according to
the email you sent me). It is a many-to-many field because each profile can have multiple
houses and each house can be used by multiple users.


The 'House' model:

The 'House' model has fields that are not related to a specific room in the house but to the house as
a whole, for example exterior cladding or exterior doors.


The rooms models:

Each of the rooms in the house has a "house" field which is a many-to-one field.
The reason is that every house can have one configuration of each
room, but each of those configurations can be applied to multiple houses.


Rooms 1, 2, 3 etc:

These are rooms that can be used for various purposes, such as bedroom, study room etc.



* 'Dropdown menu' means in general to have the user select an option out of various options,
in some sort of interface, and not necessarily the dropdown menu element.
